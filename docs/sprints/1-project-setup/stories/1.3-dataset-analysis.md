**Status:** To Do
**Assignee:** U2 (Anton Shkrebela), U4 (Mariia Volkova)
**Priority:** High
**Sprint:** 1 - Project Setup

## Description

As a data scientist, I want to analyze existing datasets so that I know what training data is available for each model.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] HuggingFace datasets downloaded and analyzed
- [ ] Kaggle datasets downloaded and analyzed
- [ ] Data quality report created for each dataset
- [ ] Training data sources selected for each model
- [ ] Data gaps identified

---

## Tasks

- [ ] Download Dewa/Dog_Emotion_Dataset_v2 from HuggingFace
- [ ] Download Q-b1t/Dogs_Emotions_Dataset from HuggingFace
- [ ] Download Dog Emotions Prediction from Kaggle
- [ ] Download Dog Emotions - 5 Classes from Kaggle
- [ ] Download DogFLW (keypoints) from Kaggle
- [ ] Analyze image quality, resolution, class balance
- [ ] Create data summary spreadsheet
- [ ] Write evaluation report
