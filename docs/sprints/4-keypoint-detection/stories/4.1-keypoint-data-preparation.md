# Story 4.1: Keypoint Data Preparation

**Status:** To Do
**Assignee:** U2 (Anton Shkrebela)
**Priority:** High
**Sprint:** 4 - Keypoint Detection

---

## Description

As an ML engineer, I want to prepare keypoint training data from DogFLW dataset.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Kaggle DogFLW dataset downloaded
- [ ] Data converted to standard format
- [ ] Train/val/test split created
- [ ] Augmentations configured (flip, rotate, scale)

---

## Tasks

- [ ] Download DogFLW from Kaggle
- [ ] Analyze annotation format
- [ ] Map DogFLW points to our schema
- [ ] Create train/val/test splits
- [ ] Implement augmentation pipeline
- [ ] Create PyTorch Dataset class

---

## DogFLW to Schema Mapping

Map DogFLW facial landmarks to our 20-point schema. May need to interpolate or approximate some points.

## Output

- `data/keypoints_training/`
- `scripts/training/prepare_keypoints_data.py`
